To do this, we have used "Easy-To-Read" as the main tool, which consists of texts with simple language, spacing, colour contrast; that facilitates understanding. Besides, we have included audio and subtitles accompanying it to make it easier to follow.

The code is entirely made with HTML, CSS and Javascript and help from Materialize, a website for quick access to web code. Using the PhoneGap tool, we were able to migrate the code to .apk (Android) format and with the possibility of migrating to .ipa (IOS) format.

It is an inter-university meeting sponsored by Telefónica and held simultaneously in several cities for 48 hours, in which hackers from all over Spain develop innovative technological solutions to respond to social challenges by NGOs, foundations, institutions, universities, ...

The app won three awards in the abovementioned challenge: ‘Asprodes’ award, ‘VIII Centenary of the University of Salamanca’ award and ‘Think Big H4G’ award, besides the chance of going to the national phase of the competition and funding to be developed.
